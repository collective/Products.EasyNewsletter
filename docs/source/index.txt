General
-------
You can use EasyNewslleter to create manually mailings/newsletters 
or you can use the collection criteria to collect content.

EasyNewsletter is heavily based on Plone's Collections. In fact, the
Newsletter as well as the Issues are actually specialized Collections.

Hence you can use familiar criteria to decide which content should be part of
a newsletter.

It's a feature of Collections that sub topics are able to inherit criteria
from its parent, so all Issue instances are able to inherit criteria from the
outer Newsletter instance.

Plone's default feature of sub topics is used to create sections within the
newsletter issue. For example one can create to sections: news and events by
creating sub topics which collect just this kind of content objects.

Once the content is generated one could edit the text as ususal in Plone.

You can create own templates to structure the selected content. Please refer
to the provided "default"-template to see how it works.
