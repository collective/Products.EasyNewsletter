Usage
=====

General
-------
You can use EasyNewsletter to manually create mailings/newsletters 
or you can use the collection criteria to collect content.

EasyNewsletter is heavily based on Plone's Collections. In fact, the
Newsletter as well as the Issues are actually specialized Collections.

Hence you can use familiar criteria to decide which content should be part of
a newsletter.

It's a feature of Collections that subtopics are able to inherit criteria
from its parent, so all Issue instances are able to inherit criteria from the
outer Newsletter instance.

Plone's default feature of subtopics is used to create sections within the
newsletter issue. For example one can create two sections - news and events - by
creating subtopics which collect just this kind of content objects.

Once the content is generated one can edit the text as usual in Plone.

You can create your own templates to structure the selected content. Please refer
to the provided "default" template to see how it works.

Step by step
------------

1. Add a EasyNewsletter instance, fill in the form and save it.

2. If you want to write a simple manual mailing, you can add an Issue and fill it out with your text.

3. Or if you want to use collections to collect you content first, then you can add an Issue,
   go to Criteria tab and add the criteria, which shall be applied to *all* of 
   your Newsletters, e.g. "Items Type".

4. You can create more than one subcollection to build categories like news, events and pictures in your newsletter. 
   Just add some collections to the newsletter itself and define your criteria for all of them. 
   The issues will combine them into different part in your content area.

5. Go to the view tab and call ``Aggregate body content`` from the action menu.

6. You can also add subcollections and define criteria on Issue level.

7. Go to Send tab and push ``Test Newsletter``.

8. If your Newsletter/Mailing is finished, you can activate the send button by clicking on ``Enable send button``. 
   Then you can click on ``Send newsletter`` to send the Newsletter to all subscribers or selected groups and users.

Images in HTML mails
--------------------

- All images with relative urls in ``src`` attribute, like the ones added by TinyMCE, are included and attached to the mail.
- All images with absolute urls in ``src`` attribute are not attached but included in HTML with the original ``src`` url.

Elements for mails only
-----------------------

If you want some elements, let's say a logo only in mails but not in the public view, you can put it inside a div tag with a class "mailonly". All div elements with class "mailonly" are filtered out in the public view.

Configuring external subscriber sources
---------------------------------------

An external subscriber sources provides (additional) subscriber to a newsletter instance.

You configure an external subscriber source as a Zope 3 utility providing ISubscriberSource
(here's an example where subscriptions are managed externally through MongoDB)::


    class NewsletterSource(object):

        implements(ISubscriberSource)

        def getSubscribers(self, newsletter):
            """ return all subscribers for the given newsletter
                from the MyInfo user database. Newsletter subscriptions
                are referenced inside MyInfo through UIDs.
            """

            uid = newsletter.UID()

            # find MyInfo subscribers
            myinfo = getUtility(IMyInfo)
            subscribers = list()
            for user in myinfo.accounts.find({'data.newsletters': uid, 'state': 'active'}):
                subscribers.append(dict(email=user['email'], fullname=user['username']))
            return subscribers


The utility must be registered using ZCML::

    <utility zcml:condition="installed Products.EasyNewsletter"
        name="MyInfo subscribers"
        factory=".newsletter.NewsletterSource"
        />

Inside the ``Edit`` view of the instance under the ``External`` tab you should find
``MyInfo subscribers`` under the option ``External subscriber source``.
