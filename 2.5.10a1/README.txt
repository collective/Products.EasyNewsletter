    class NewsletterSource(object):

        implements(ISubscriberSource)

        def getSubscribers(self, newsletter):
            """ return all subscribers for the given newsletter
                from the MyInfo user database. Newsletter subscriptions
                are referenced inside MyInfo through UIDs.
            """

            uid = newsletter.UID()

            # find MyInfo subscribers
            myinfo = getUtility(IMyInfo)
            subscribers = list()
            for user in myinfo.accounts.find({'data.newsletters' : uid, 'state' : 'active'}):
                subscribers.append(dict(email=user['email'],
                                        fullname=user['username']))
